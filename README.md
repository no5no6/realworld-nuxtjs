> ### [Nuxt 2](https://v2.nuxt.com) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://realworld.no5no6.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Nuxt 2](https://v2.nuxt.com)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works
